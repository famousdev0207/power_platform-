# Getting Started with HubSpot Workflows and Power Automate

In order to use HubSpot Workflows as a trigger with Power Automate, you will need to first configure a instant cloud flow using the 'When a HTTP request is received' [trigger](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/http-connectors/4-http-request). After saving the flow, the trigger will populate with a HTTP Post URL you will use later with your HubSpot Workflow.

It is highly recommended that a separate flow be created for each HubSpot object workflow in order to minimize JSON parse errors, e.g. workflows for new contacts and contact updates, with best practice being separate flows for each object action. An example using the default HubSpot fields for contacts can be [found here](Contact%20JSON.json). Keep in mind that if your HubSpot object have any custom fields or you later add custom fields, you will need to generate the schema again using the new JSON payload.

[HubSpot Workflows](https://knowledge.hubspot.com/workflows/create-workflows) can be found on the menu bar in your HubSpot account. You can create workflows for any object that your account has access to:

  - Contacts
  - Companies
  - Deals
  - Conversations
  - Quotes (with Sales Hub Enterprise)
  - Tickets (with Service Hub Professional or Enterprise)
  - Custom objects (Enterprise only)

Similar to Power Automate, Workflows are built using a trigger and subsequent actions.

A trigger can only select one HubSpot object to monitor, but within that object, multiple filters can selected using any of the object fields with And and Or rules. Once your trigger is configured, you will need to add a 'Trigger Webhook' action. In the Webhook URL textbox, add the URL the flow trigger generated and click Save. You will now need to review the workflow configuration and turn the workflow on to start triggers to Power Automate.

The HTTP call from HubSpot is queued, so expect a delay of 10 seconds or more before the Power Automate trigger starts.
